        Arrow is used in the state store and standard ingest, and is also a dependency of Spark. Because it's a
        dependency of Spark, the version we're able to use is restricted by support in AWS EMR.

        This affects the Arrow R package, which we don't use internally. It doesn't seem to affect the Arrow
        implementations that we use.

        This was found against Arrow 12.0.1.
