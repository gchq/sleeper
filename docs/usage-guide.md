Interacting with an instance of Sleeper
=======================================

This contains information on the available methods to interact with a deployed instance of Sleeper.

This will assume you have a deployed instance of Sleeper, and you've built the system locally in a builder container.
See the [getting started guide](getting-started.md) for how to set that up. Also see
the [deployment guide](deployment-guide.md) for more information on deploying an instance.

If you just want to test locally, see the documentation on [deploying to localstack](usage/deploy-to-localstack.md).
This has very limited functionality compared to a deployed instance.
