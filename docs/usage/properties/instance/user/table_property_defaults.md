Any transactions after the snapshot will never be deleted as they are still in active use.<br>This should be configured in relation to the property which determines whether a process will load the latest snapshot or instead seek through the transaction log, since we need to preserve transactions that may still be read:<br>sleeper.default.statestore.snapshot.load.min.transactions.ahead<br>The snapshot that will be considered the latest snapshot is configured by a property to set the minimum age for it to count for this:<br>sleeper.default.statestore.transactionlog.delete.behind.snapshot.min.age<br>                                                                                                                                                       | 200                        | false                       |
