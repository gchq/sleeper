Use this to specify your own buckets that already exist in the same AWS account. Sleeper will not create these. The Sleeper CDK deployment will assign permissions to the ingest and bulk import systems so that they can consume data from these buckets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |               | true                        |
