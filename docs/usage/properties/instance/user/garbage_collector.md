| sleeper.gc.batch.size             | The number of deleted files recorded to the state store in a single commit.<br>The garbage collector keeps deleting files as long as there are files to delete in the state store, and updates the state store whenever it has deleted this many files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10000         | false                       |
| sleeper.gc.files.maximum          | The maximum number of files that can be deleted per invocation of the garbage collector.<br>If a batch of files exceeds this limit, the whole batch will be deleted before terminating.<br>This limit is applied separately for each Sleeper table.<br>This restriction is placed to avoid reaching the lambda timeout for the garbage collector. If this timeout is met, it is most likely to happen whilst deleting a batch of files. This would result in files being deleted, but the state store not being updated. Any files caught in such a state will be found on the next garbage collector run and deleted again, updating the state store as expected. | 750000        | false                       |
| sleeper.default.gc.delay.minutes  | A file will not be deleted until this number of minutes have passed after it has been marked as ready for garbage collection. The reason for not deleting files immediately after they have been marked as ready for garbage collection is that they may still be in use by queries. This property can be overridden on a per-table basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 15            | false                       |
