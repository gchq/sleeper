## Table Properties - Data Definition

The following table properties relate to the definition of data inside a table.

| Property Name                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Default Value |

| sleeper.table.id                  | A unique ID identifying this table, generated by Sleeper on table creation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |               |
| sleeper.table.online              | A boolean flag representing whether this table is online or offline.<br>An offline table will not have any partition splitting or compaction jobs run automatically.<br>Note that taking a table offline will not stop any partitions that are being split or compaction jobs that are running. Additionally, you are still able to ingest data to offline tables and perform queries against them. | true          |
| sleeper.table.schema              | The schema representing the structure of this table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |               |
| sleeper.table.data.engine         | Select which data engine to use for the table. DataFusion support is experimental. Even with DataFusion enabled, DataFusion will only be used in queries if environment variable DF_QUERY is non null. Valid values are: [java, datafusion]                                                                                                                                                         | JAVA          |
| sleeper.table.iterator.class.name | Fully qualified class of a custom iterator to use when iterating over the values in this table. Defaults to nothing. May also have special value "AGGREGATORS" indicating the use of experimental iterators that are only usable with the DataFusion compactor. When this marker is present, attempting to compact with the table with the default Java compactor will fail.                        |               |
| sleeper.table.iterator.config     | Iterator configuration. An iterator will be initialised with the following configuration. If a DataFusion only iterator is specified, then the configuration should be as described in https://github.com/gchq/sleeper/issues/4344 for DataFusion.                                                                                                                                                  |               |
| sleeper.table.filters             | Property to configure a filter on a column on a table. Currently only accepts ageOff(column,age).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |               |
| sleeper.table.aggregations        | Property to configure aggregation of columns from the table. Format accepted: op(column),op(column)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |               |
