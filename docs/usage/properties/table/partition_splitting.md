| sleeper.table.splits.file                                  | Splits file which will be used to initialise the partitions for this table. Defaults to nothing and the table will be created with a single root partition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |               |
| sleeper.table.splits.base64.encoded                        | Flag to set if you have base64 encoded the split points (only used for string key types and defaults to false).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | false         |
| sleeper.table.partition.splitting.threshold                | Partitions in this table with more than the following number of rows in will be split.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 1000000000    |
| sleeper.table.partition.splitting.min.rows                 | When expanding the partition tree explicitly, this many rows are required in the input data to be able to split a partition. This will be used when pre-splitting partitions.<br>For example, during bulk import when there are too few leaf partitions, the partition tree will be extended based on the data in the bulk import job. The bulk import job must contain at least this much data per new split point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 1000          |
| sleeper.table.partition.splitting.min.distribution.percent | When expanding the partition tree explicitly, this is the minimum percentage of the expected number of rows to split a partition assuming an even distribution of rows.<br>For example, during bulk import when there are too few leaf partitions, the partition tree will be extended based on the data in the bulk import job. For each current leaf partition, we make a sketch of the data from the job that's in that partition. We divide the number of rows in the job's input data by the current number of leaf partitions, to get the expected rows per partition. If this propery is set to 10, then any partition with less than 10% of the expected rows per partition will be ignored when extending the partition tree. | 10            |
| sleeper.table.partition.splitting.commit.async             | If true, partition splits will be applied via asynchronous requests sent to the state store committer lambda. If false, the partition splitting lambda will apply splits synchronously.<br>This is only applied if async commits are enabled for the table. The default value is set in an instance property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | true          |
