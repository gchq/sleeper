## The following properties relate to bulk import, i.e. ingesting data using Spark jobs running on EMR
## or EKS.
## 
## Note that on EMR, the total resource allocation must align with the instance types used for the
## cluster. For the maximum memory usage, combine the memory and memory overhead properties, and
## compare against the maximum memory allocation for YARN in the Hadoop task configuration:
## 
## https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-hadoop-task-config.html
## 
## As an example, if we use m7i.xlarge for executor instances, that has a maximum allocation of 54272
## MiB, or 53 GiB. If we want 3 executors per instance, we can have 53 GiB / 3 = 18,090.666 MiB per
## executor. We can set the executor memory to 16 GiB, and the executor memory overhead to the
## remainder of that amount, which is 18,090 MiB - 16 GiB = 1,706 MiB, or 1.666 GiB. This is just above
## the default Spark memory overhead factor of 0.1, i.e. 16 GiB x 0.1 = 1.6 GiB.
