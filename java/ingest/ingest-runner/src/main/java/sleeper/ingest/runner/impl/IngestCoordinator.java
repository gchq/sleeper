/**
 * Writes data to Sleeper partition files. The ingest process works as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Data is provided to this class through the {@link #write(Object)} method. These data may be supplied as any data
 * type are stored in a {@link RecordBatch} for that data type.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * When the {@link RecordBatch} is full, the data is retrieved from the {@link RecordBatch} as {@link Record} objects,
 * in sorted order.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The sorted rows are passed to an {@link IngesterIntoPartitions} object, which uses
 * {@link sleeper.ingest.runner.impl.partitionfilewriter.PartitionFileWriter} objects to create the partition files in
 * the
 * appropriate file system, possibly asynchronously.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Once all of the partition files have been created, the Sleeper {@link StateStore} is updated to include the new
 * partition files.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The {@link RecordBatch} is cleared, its resources freed, and a new one is created to accept more data.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * So long as this {@link IngestCoordinator} remains open, more data can be supplied and more partition files will
 * be created if required.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * When this {@link IngestCoordinator} is closed, any remaining data is written to partition files and a
 * {@link CompletableFuture} is returned that will complete once all of the files have been fully ingested and any
 * intermediate files removed.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The {@link RecordBatch} and the {@link sleeper.ingest.runner.impl.partitionfilewriter.PartitionFileWriter} to use are
 * specified using factory functions that create
 * objects which satisfy the relevant interfaces.
 *
 * @param <INCOMINGDATATYPE> The type of data that the class accepts.
