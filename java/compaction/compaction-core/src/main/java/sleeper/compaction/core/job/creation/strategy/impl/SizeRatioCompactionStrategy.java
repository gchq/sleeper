/**
 * A compaction strategy that is similar to the strategy used in Accumulo.
 * Given files sorted into increasing size order, it tests whether the sum of the
 * sizes of the files excluding the largest is greater than or equal to a ratio
 * (3 by default) times the size of the largest. If this test is met then a
 * job is created from those files. If the test is not met then the largest file
 * is removed from the list of files and the test is repeated. This continues
 * until either a set of files matching the criteria is found, or there is only
 * one file left.
 * <p>
 * If this results in a group of files of size less than or equal to
 * sleeper.table.compaction.files.batch.size then a compaction job is created
 * for these files. Otherwise the files are split into batches and jobs are
 * created as long as the batch also meets the criteria.
 * <p>
 * The table property sleeper.table.compaction.strategy.sizeratio.max.concurrent.jobs.per.partition
 * controls how many jobs can be running concurrently for each partition.
