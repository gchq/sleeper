# The following properties are specific to the system tests. These should be added
# to the end of a standard properties file.

# The ingest mode to write random data. This should be either 'direct' or 'queue'.
# 'Direct' means that the data is written directly. 'Queue' means that the data
# is written to a Parquet file and an ingest job is created and posted to the
# ingest queue.
ingestMode=direct

# The number of containers that write random data
numberOfWriters=1

# The number of random records that each container should write
numberOfRecordsPerWriter=500000000

# The amount of CPU and memory for the containers that write random data
systemTestTaskCPUAndMemory=1024-4096

# The minimum value of integers generated randomly during random record generation
minRandomInt=0

# The maximum value of integers generated randomly during random record generation
maxRandomInt=100000000

# The minimum value of longs generated randomly during random record generation
minRandomLong=0

# The maximum value of longs generated randomly during random record generation
maxRandomLong=10000000000

# The length of strings generated randomly during random record generation
randomStringLength=10

# The length of byte arrays generated randomly during random record generation
randomByteArrayLength=10

# The maximum number of entries in maps generated randomly during random record generation
# (the number of entries in the map will range randomly from 0 to this number)
maxEntriesRandomMap=10

# The maximum number of entries in lists generated randomly during random record generation
# (the number of entries in the list will range randomly from 0 to this number)
maxEntriesRandomList=10

# The image in ECR used for writing random data to the system
