You've done some work towards another issue but haven't finished it yet. You want to integrate your changes into the
rest of the project before you continue your work on the issue. This will mean others can see your changes in their copy
of the code, and they can take your work into account in anything they're doing. This is great!

Please complete the link below to link this to the issue you're working on. Give this new issue a name that describes
the changes you will include in a pull request.

Split from:
- https://github.com/gchq/sleeper/issues/XXX

For tracking reasons, we want each pull request to be linked to an issue that it resolves. For an issue that's still in
progress, please don't link a pull request to the original because that would trigger GitHub to close the original issue
when the pull request is merged. Instead, you can link your pull request to a new issue that's split from the original.

Any changes you make must still pass all tests and linting. Your code in progress should still follow
[our conventions](https://github.com/gchq/sleeper/blob/develop/docs/development/conventions.md), and should
still include automated test coverage following
[our test strategy](https://github.com/gchq/sleeper/blob/develop/docs/development/test-strategy.md).

Alternatively you could raise a normal feature issue and link that to the original in the background section. You can
use a "Split from:" link as shown above. That gives you an opportunity to include more information about the intention
and any analysis.
