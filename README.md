Sleeper
=======

## Introduction

Sleeper is a serverless, cloud-native, log-structured merge tree based, scalable key-value store. It is designed to
allow the ingest of very large volumes of data at low cost. Queries for rows where the key takes a given value takes
around 1-2 seconds, but many thousands can be run in parallel. Each individual query has a negligible cost.

Data is stored as rows in tables. A table has a schema with key fields, optional sort fields, and some value fields.
A metadata store tracks Parquet files in S3. These files contain rows in sorted order, by the key field and then by
the sort field. Files exist within a partition, which each contain data for a range of keys.

Sleeper can be thought of as a cloud-native reimagining of systems such as Hbase and Accumulo. The architecture is
very different to those systems. Sleeper has no long running servers. This means that if there is no work to be done,
i.e. no data is being ingested and no background operations such as compactions are in progress, then the only cost
is the cost of the storage. There are no wasted compute cycles, i.e. it is "serverless".

The current codebase can only be deployed to AWS, but there is nothing in the design that limits it to AWS. In time
we would like to be able to deploy Sleeper to other public cloud environments such as Microsoft Azure
or to a Kubernetes cluster.
