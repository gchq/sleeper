# Install Rust
# Change install location because the default is in the home directory, which is overwritten by Dev Containers.
# We need to make it accessible to the non-root user. If we installed Rust directly as that user, we would need to
# update the file ownership of the whole Rust installation when we change the user's UID/GID.
# We install Rust as a separate, real user to own the install directory. We don't use a system user for this because the
# Rust install script expects to run in a real user account.
